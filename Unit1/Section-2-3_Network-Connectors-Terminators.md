Recap: 
- We have three main types of cables
	- Copper (cat5+) 
	- Multimode fiber (shorter distance, high speed) 
	- Single mode fiber (longer distances, highest speed) 
- SFP slots on network devices allow us to pick and choose what connections we want.

  

Network Closets 
- Where the networking gear is stored. 
- Each building will have an 
	- MDF (Main distribution Frame) 
		- Connections that leave the building 
	- And potentially multiple IDFs (Intermediate Distribution Frames) 
		- Connections that connect back to the MDF 
- Network racks, similar to server racks but deeper
- Switches 
	- Things all switches are connected to are “patch panels” 
	- These are labeled Cat5 connections with the blue cables coming out of the back on the picture.

- The blue cables will be the ones that go into the wall panels and into your office. 
- The patch panel itself will have room to label to show where each blue cable goes. 
- The red cable is the cable that connects the switches together. 
- The orange one is the multimode fiber.
